title: 'Soft Matching Distance: A metric on neural representations that captures single-neuron
  tuning'
openreview: BJ2SmiCZrM
abstract: Common measures of neural representational (dis)similarity are designed
  to be insensitive to rotations and reflections of the neural activation space. Motivated
  by the premise that the tuning of individual units may be important, there has been
  recent interest in developing stricter notions of representational (dis)similarity
  that require neurons to be individually matched across networks. When two networks
  have the same size (i.e. same number of neurons), a distance metric can be formulated
  by optimizing over neuron index permutations to maximize tuning curve alignment.
  However, it is not clear how to generalize this metric to measure distances between
  networks with different sizes. Here, we leverage a connection to optimal transport
  theory to derive a natural generalization based on “soft” permutations. The resulting
  metric is symmetric, satisfies the triangle inequality, and can be interpreted as
  a Wasserstein distance between two empirical distributions. Further, our proposed
  metric avoids counter-intuitive outcomes suffered by alternative approaches, and
  captures complementary geometric insights into neural representations that are entirely
  missed by rotation-invariant metrics.
