title: 'NoPose-NeuS: Jointly Optimizing Camera Poses with Neural Implicit Surfaces
  for Multi-view Reconstruction'
openreview: TOp8uT3DZ9
abstract: Learning neural implicit surfaces from volume rendering has become popular
  for multi-view reconstruction. Neural surface reconstruction approaches can recover
  complex 3D geometry that are difficult for classical Multi-view Stereo (MVS) approaches,
  such as non-Lambertian surfaces and thin structures. However, one key assumption
  for these methods is knowing accurate camera parameters for the input multi-view
  images, which are not always available. In this paper, we present NoPose-NeuS, a
  neural implicit surface reconstruction method that extends NeuS to jointly optimize
  camera poses with the geometry and color networks. We encode the camera poses as
  a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce two additional losses, which are multi-view
  feature consistency and rendered depth losses, to constrain the learned geometry
  for better estimated camera poses and scene surfaces. Extensive experiments on the
  DTU dataset show that the proposed method can estimate relatively accurate camera
  poses, while maintaining a high surface reconstruction quality with 0.89 mean Chamfer
  distance.
