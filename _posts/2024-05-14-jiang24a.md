title: On Transferring Expert Knowledge from Tabular Data to Images
openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=qNZ3Tyrq9C
abstract: Transferring knowledge across modalities has garnered significant attention
  in the field of machine learning as it enables the utilization of expert knowledge
  from diverse domains. In particular, the representation of expert knowledge in tabular
  form, commonly found in fields such as medicine, can greatly enhance the comprehensiveness
  and accuracy of image-based learning. However, the transfer of knowledge from tabular
  to image data presents unique challenges due to the distinct characteristics of
  these data types, making it challenging to determine "how to reuse" and "which subset
  to reuse". To address this, we propose a novel method called CHannel tAbulaR alignment
  with optiMal tranSport (CHARMS) that automatically and effectively transfers relevant
  tabular knowledge. Specifically, by maximizing the mutual information between a
  group of channels and tabular features, our method modifies the visual embedding
  and captures the semantics of tabular knowledge. The alignment between channels
  and attributes helps select the subset of tabular data which contains knowledge
  to images. Experimental results demonstrate that {\sc Charms} effectively reuses
  tabular knowledge to improve the performance and interpretability of visual classifiers.
