title: Unsupervised learning on spontaneous retinal activity leads to efficient neural
  representation geometry
openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=iZ3me8unMJ
abstract: Prior to the onset of vision, neurons in the developing mammalian retina
  spontaneously fire in correlated activity patterns known as retinal waves. Experimental
  evidence suggests that retinal waves strongly influence the emergence of sensory
  representations before visual experience. We aim to model this early stage of functional
  development by using movies of neurally active developing retinas as pre-training
  data for neural networks. Specifically, we pre-train a ResNet-18 with an unsupervised
  contrastive learning objective (SimCLR) on both simulated and experimentally-obtained
  movies of retinal waves, then evaluate its performance on image classification tasks.
  We find that pre-training on retinal waves significantly improves performance on
  tasks that test object invariance to spatial translation, while slightly improving
  performance on more complex tasks like image classification. Notably, these performance
  boosts are realized on held-out natural images even though the pre-training procedure
  does not include any natural image data. We then propose a geometrical explanation
  for the increase in network performance, namely that the spatiotemporal characteristics
  of retinal waves facilitate the formation of separable feature representations.
  In particular, we demonstrate that networks pre-trained on retinal waves are more
  effective at separating image manifolds than randomly initialized networks, especially
  for manifolds defined by sets of spatial translations. These findings indicate that
  the broad spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves prepare networks for higher
  order feature extraction.
