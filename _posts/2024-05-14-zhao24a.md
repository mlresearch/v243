title: 'NEUCORE: Neural Concept Reasoning for Composed Image Retrieval'
openreview: v1qKZooY4z
abstract: Composed image retrieval which combines a reference image and a text modifier
  to identify the desired target image is a challenging task, and requires the model
  to comprehend both vision and language modalities and their interactions. Existing
  approaches focus on holistic multi-modal interaction modeling, and ignore the composed
  and complimentary property between the reference image and text modifier. In order
  to better utilize the complementarity of multi-modal inputs for effective information
  fusion and retrieval, we move the multi-modal understanding to fine-granularity
  at concept-level, and learn the multi-modal concept alignment to identify the visual
  location in reference or target images corresponding to text modifier. Toward the
  end, we propose a NEUral COncept REasoning (NEUCORE) model which incorporates multi-modal
  concept alignment and progressive multi-modal fusion over aligned concepts. Specifically,
  considering that text modifier may refer to semantic concepts not existing in the
  reference image and requiring to be added into the target image, we learn the multi-modal
  concept alignment between the text modifier and the concatenation of reference and
  target images, under multiple-instance learning framework with image and sentence
  level weak supervision. Furthermore, based on aligned concepts, to form discriminative
  fusion features of the input modalities for accurate target image retrieval, we
  propose a progressive fusion strategy with unified execution architecture instantiated
  by the attended language semantic concepts. Our proposed approach is evaluated on
  three datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.
