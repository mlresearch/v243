title: Object-Centric Semantic Vector Quantization
openreview: NSfecLF4Za
abstract: Neural discrete representations are crucial components of modern neural
  networks. However, their main limitation is that the primary strategies such as
  VQ-VAE can only provide representations at the patch level. Therefore, one of the
  main goals of representation learning, acquiring conceptual, semantic, and compositional
  abstractions such as the color and shape of an object, remains elusive. In this
  paper, we present the first approach to semantic neural discrete representation
  learning. The proposed model, called Semantic Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder
  (SVQ), leverages recent advances in unsupervised object-centric learning to address
  this limitation. Specifically, we observe that a simple approach quantizing at the
  object level poses a significant challenge and propose constructing scene representations
  hierarchically, from low-level discrete concept schemas to object representations.
  Additionally, we suggest a novel method for training a prior over these semantic
  representations, enabling the ability to generate images following the underlying
  data distribution, which is lacking in most object-centric models. In experiments
  on various 2D and 3D object-centric datasets, we find that our model achieves superior
  generation performance compared to non-semantic vector quantization methods such
  as VQ-VAE and previous object-centric generative models. Furthermore, we find that
  the semantic discrete representations can solve downstream scene understanding tasks
  that require reasoning about the properties of different objects in the scene.
