title: Randomly Weighted Neuromodulation in Neural Networks Facilitates Learning of
  Manifolds Common Across Tasks
openreview: EHvgtRcrix
abstract: Geometric Sensitive Hashing functions, a family of Local Sensitive Hashing
  functions, are neural network models that learn class-specific manifold geometry
  in supervised learning. However, given a set of supervised learning tasks, understanding
  the manifold geometries that can represent each task and the kinds of relationships
  between the tasks based on them has received little attention. We explore a formalization
  of this question by considering a generative process where each task is associated
  with a high-dimensional manifold, which can be done in brain-like models with neuromodulatory
  systems. Following this formulation, we define Task-specific Geometric Sensitive
  Hashing and show that a randomly weighted neural network with a neuromodulation
  system can realize this function.
