title: Role Taxonomy of Units in Deep Neural Networks
openreview: GpBQYrTEPG
abstract: Identifying the role of network units in deep neural networks (DNNs) is
  critical in many aspects including giving understandings on the mechanisms of DNNs
  and building basic connections between deep learning and neuroscience. However,
  there remains unclear on which roles the units in DNNs with different generalization
  ability could present. To this end, we give role taxonomy of units in DNNs, where
  units are categorized into four types in terms of their functional preference on
  separately the training set and testing set. We show that ratios of the four categories
  are highly associated with the generalization ability of DNNs from two distinct
  perspectives, based on which we give signs of DNNs with well generalization.
