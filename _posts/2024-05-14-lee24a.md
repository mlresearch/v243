title: 'Semi-Ensemble: A Simple Approach Over-parameterize Model Interpolation'
openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=m33S4kCJSd
abstract: We develop a unified framework for interpolating two models with various
  degrees of over-parameterization, having model merging and model ensemble as special
  cases. Instead of directly interpolating models in their original parameter space,
  the proposed Semi-Ensemble interpolates the over-parameterized versions of the models
  in a higher-dimensional joint parameter space. Here, the over-parameterizations
  recover each endpoint model when projected to some low-dimensional subspace spanned
  by a fraction of bases. By carefully constructing the joint parameter space, the
  interpolated model can achieve a smooth tradeoff between the total number of parameters
  and the model accuracy, outperforming existing baselines. Intriguingly, we show
  that Semi-ensembles can sometimes achieve a better performance than vanilla ensembles,
  even with a slightly smaller number of parameters.
