title: 'DisCoV: Disentangling Time Series Representations via Contrastive based $l$-Variational
  Inference'
openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZPmx1ncKpr
abstract: Learning disentangled representations is crucial for Time Series, offering
  benefits like feature derivation and improved interpretability, thereby enhancing
  task performance. We focus on disentangled representation learning for home appliance
  electricity usage, enabling users to understand and optimize their consumption for
  a reduced carbon footprint. Our approach frames the problem as disentangling each
  attribute’s role in total consumption (e.g., dishwashers, fridges, …). Unlike existing
  methods assuming attribute independence, we acknowledge real-world time series attribute
  correlations, like the operating of dishwashers and washing machines during the
  winter season. To tackle this, we employ weakly supervised contrastive disentanglement,
  facilitating representation generalization across diverse correlated scenarios and
  new households. Our method utilizes innovative $l$-variational inference layers
  with self-attention, effectively addressing temporal dependencies across bottom-up
  and top-down networks. We find that DisCoV (Disentangling via Contrastive $l$-Variational)
  can enhance the task of reconstructing electricity consumption for individual appliances.
  We introduce TDS (Time Disentangling Score) to gauge disentanglement quality. TDS
  reliably reflects disentanglement performance, making it a valuable metric for evaluating
  time series representations. Code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DisCo.
