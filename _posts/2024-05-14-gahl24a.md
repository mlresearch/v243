title: Visual Expertise Explains Image Inversion Effects
openreview: KWYQu2TxhE
abstract: 'We present an anatomically-inspired neurocomputational model, including
  a foveated retina and the log-polar mapping from the visual field to the primary
  visual cortex, that recreates image inversion effects long seen in psychophysical
  studies. We show that visual expertise, the ability to discriminate between subordinate-level
  categories, changes the performance of the model on inverted images. We first explore
  face discrimination, which, in humans, relies on configural information. The log-polar
  transform disrupts configural information in an inverted image and leaves featural
  information relatively unaffected. We suggest this is responsible for the degradation
  of performance with inverted faces. We then recreate the effect with other subordinate-level
  category discriminators and show that the inversion effect arises as a result of
  visual expertise, where configural information becomes relevant as more identities
  are learned at the subordinate-level. Our model matches the classic result: faces
  suffer more from inversion than mono-oriented objects, which are more disrupted
  than non-mono-oriented objects when objects are only familiar at a basic-level,
  and simultaneously shows that expert-level discrimination of other subordinate-level
  categories respond similarly to inversion as face experts.'
