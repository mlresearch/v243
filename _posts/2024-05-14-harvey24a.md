title: Duality of Bures and Shape Distances with Implications for Comparing Neural
  Representations
openreview: ydiDTfdbzP
abstract: A multitude of (dis)similarity measures between neural networks representations
  have been proposed, resulting in a fragmented research landscape. Most (dis)similarity
  measures fall into one of two categories. First, measures such as linear regression,
  canonical correlations analysis (CCA), and shape distances, all learn explicit mappings
  between neural units to quantify similarity while accounting for expected invariances.
  Second, measures such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel
  alignment (CKA), and normalized Bures similarity (NBS) all quantify similarity in
  summary statistics that are already invariant to such symmetries (e.g. by comparing
  stimulus-by-stimulus kernel matrices). Here, we take steps towards unifying these
  two broad categories of methods by observing that the cosine of the Riemannian shape
  distance (from category 1) is equal to NBS (from category 2). We explore how this
  connection leads to new interpretations of shape distances and NBS, and draw contrasts
  of these measures with CKA, a popular similarity measure in the deep learning literature.
