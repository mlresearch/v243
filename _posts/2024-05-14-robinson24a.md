title: A sparse null code emerges in deep neural networks
openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=GIuSksGwEp
abstract: 'The internal representations of deep vision models are often assumed to
  encode specific image features, such as contours, textures, and object parts. However,
  it is possible for deep networks to learn highly abstract representations that may
  not be linked to any specific image feature. Here we present evidence for one such
  abstract representation in transformers and modern convolutional architectures that
  appears to serve as a null code, indicating image regions that are non-diagnostic
  for the object class. These null codes are both statistically and qualitatively
  distinct from the more commonly reported feature-related codes of vision models.
  Specifically, these null codes have several distinct characteristics: they are highly
  sparse, they have a single unique activation pattern for each network, they emerge
  abruptly at intermediate network depths, and they are activated in a feature-independent
  manner by weakly informative image regions, such as backgrounds. Together, these
  findings reveal a new class of highly abstract representations in deep vision models:
  sparse null codes that seem to indicate the absence of relevant features.'
